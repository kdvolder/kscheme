This directory contains files that provide SLIB features specific
to KScheme.

THe files are specific to KScheme either because:

  a) They are not part of a standard SLib distribution
  
  b) They are implemented specifically for KScheme.
  
The file mkimpcat.scm in the implementation vicinity (parent directory of this one)
is supposed to build the catalog for the features provided by files in this
directory.
